# Cheatsheet: Agent Execution

Minimal notes for building and debugging agent-based graphs.

## Execution Loop
- Perception → Planning → Action → Observation
- Use state object to accumulate context and decisions.

## Tips
- Log every tool call and its result.
- Bound the number of steps to prevent loops.
- Keep prompts short; store long context in state.

## Snippets
- TODO: Paste a minimal agent loop from your experiments.
