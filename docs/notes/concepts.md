# LangGraph Concepts (Notes)

Short notes you refine over time. Keep each section tiny.

## State & Messages
- Single source of truth for the graph.
- Prefer explicit types for clarity.

## Nodes & Transitions
- Nodes do work; edges decide where to go next.

## Control Flow
- Branching, loops, and termination conditions.

## Observability
- Log transitions, inputs/outputs.
- Save traces for later analysis.
