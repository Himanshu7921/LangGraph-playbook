# Autonomicity Levels in AI Systems (LangGraph Lens)

This note captures a practical scale of "autonomicity" — how much initiative a system can take without hand-holding — and how LangGraph helps you climb that scale.

## Level 0 — If/Else Code (Rule-Based)
- Deterministic code and brittle control flow
- You must enumerate every if/else branch; edge cases are easy to miss
- Zero ability to generalize beyond what you hardcode

Limitations
- Not scalable for open-ended, real-world tasks
- Maintenance cost rises with branches; logic becomes spaghetti

## Level 1 — Single LLM Call (One Agent)
- One LLM + optional tools; does everything in a single step
- Slightly more autonomous than Level 0 but still shallow

Limitations
- Prone to hallucinations and loss of context
- Hard to orchestrate multi-step plans or recover from errors

## Level 2 — Chains
- Compose multiple prompts/tools into a predefined path
- Great for known, linear workflows

Limitations
- Path rigidity: every request follows the same sequence
- Nonlinear/branchy problems waste steps or fail silently

## Level 3 — Routing
- Introduce a router to dispatch inputs to the right sub-graph/agent
- Dynamic path selection per input

Benefits
- Better fit to problem variety without hardcoding long chains
- Reduces wasted computation by skipping irrelevant steps

## Level 4 — State Machines (Agentic Graphs)
- Formalize control flow as a graph with nodes (work), edges (transitions), and shared state (memory)
- Cycles allowed: implement critic/reviewer loops, retries, and escalation

Key Ideas (LangGraph)
- State: a typed, evolving record of the conversation/task
- Nodes: pure(ish) functions that read/update state
- Edges: choose the next node — deterministically or conditionally
- Termination: explicit end condition to avoid infinite loops
- Critic/Reviewer: a node that evaluates results and routes back for refinement

Why this matters
- Observability: logs and traces follow the graph
- Reliability: explicit transitions reduce hidden control flow bugs
- Composability: reuse nodes across graphs; swap branches by config

## Level 5 — Toward Fully Autonomous Agents (AGI-like Orchestration)
- Planning + tool use + memory + reflection + multi-agent collaboration
- The system chooses what to do next, when to stop, and how to learn

Where LangGraph shines
- Planning + routing + state → structured autonomy
- Easy to add supervisors/critics and safety rails

## State Machines Explained (Plain-English)
A state machine is a directed graph where:
- The state is your single source of truth
- Each node reads the current state and emits a new state
- Edges decide which node to run next based on the state
- Loops are intentional (e.g., Review → Fix → Review) with a termination guard

In LangGraph:
- You define nodes as Python callables
- You define edges/transitions with conditions or routers
- You define termination conditions to stop the loop

---

## Mapping to Experiments
- routing: build a small router that sends inputs to different handlers
- state_machines: add a reviewer loop that refines outputs until a threshold is met or a max-tries limit triggers

Use these as starting points for real projects (e.g., content pipelines, research agents).
