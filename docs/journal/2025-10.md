> One small entry a day beats a long one a week. Keep it lightweight.

- **What I tried:** Set up repo structure, wrote initial cheatsheets, prepared experiments.
- **Notes:** Keep experiments tiny and log results.
- **Next:** Implement node chaining example; start a planner agent stub.
- **Blockers:** None

- **What I tried:** Studied autonomicity levels from rule-based code → single LLM → chains → routing → state machines → toward autonomous agents.
- **Notes:** Plain code has near-zero autonomy; routing introduces dynamic paths; state machines (graphs) enable reviewer/critic loops and reliable control flow — a sweet spot for LangGraph.
- **Next:** Learn AI Agents and Tool Implementation in LangGraph.
- **Blockers:** None
