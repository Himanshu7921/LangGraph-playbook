This repository is my structured, professional playbook for learning and applying **LangGraph**, building on prior **LangChain** experience. It‚Äôs optimized for small, focused experiments; clear documentation; and repeatable patterns that scale into mini-projects.

## Documentation

This repo is designed to be your ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù for LangGraph.

- Cheatsheets: `docs/cheatsheets/` ‚Äî terse, visual, copy-ready snippets.
- Notes: `docs/notes/concepts.md` ‚Äî high-level ideas, definitions, mental models.
- Journal: `docs/journal/2025-10.md` ‚Äî one small entry per day; template included.
- Feature tracker: `docs/features.md` ‚Äî single source of truth for progress.

Guidelines
- Keep entries short. Link to experiments for detail.
- Prefer code snippets and ASCII sketches over prose when possible.
- Move stale versions into `archive/` with a date prefix.

---

## Experiments and how to run

Each experiment is small and runnable. Start with:

- `experiments/node_chaining/node_chaining.py`
- `experiments/planner_agent/planner_agent.py`

Run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
python .\experiments\node_chaining\node_chaining.py
python .\experiments\planner_agent\planner_agent.py
```

Add a new experiment
1) Create `experiments/<topic>/`
2) Copy `templates/experiment_template.md` to `<topic>/README.md`
3) Add `<topic>.py` or a notebook
4) Log results in the README and update `docs/features.md`

---

## Mini-projects and comparisons

- Mini-projects: sketch slightly larger ideas and wire multiple nodes together.
- Comparisons: `comparisons/langgraph_vs_langchain.md` for side-by-side takeaways.

Suggested mini-project ideas
- Q&A bot with retrieval + reasoning
- Workflow automation (fetch ‚Üí process ‚Üí summarize)
- Multi-agent planner simulation

---

## Daily workflow (fast iteration)

1) Journal: open `docs/journal/2025-10.md`, copy the template for today, and write 3‚Äì6 bullets.
2) Tracker: update `docs/features.md` (status, one-line note, date).
3) Experiment: add or iterate a tiny script in `experiments/` and link back in the journal.
4) Snapshot: archive older versions you want to keep in `archive/`.
5) Overview: update `structure.txt` via `generate_file_structure.py` for a current tree.

Tips
- Keep scope minimal; finish something daily.
- Log inputs/outputs to make debugging transitions trivial.
- Prefer repeatable, composable patterns (routers, fan-in/out, retries).

## Roadmap & progress tracker

Current focus
- [x] Basics of LangGraph
- [ ] Graph Nodes & Connections
- [ ] Agent Planning & Execution
- [ ] Integrating External APIs
- [ ] Advanced Pipelines

Track granular progress in `docs/features.md` (‚úÖ Done | üîÑ WIP | üß™ Testing | ‚è≥ Planned | ‚ùå Blocked).

## How to use this as a template

This repository includes a reusable generator prompt at the root:
- `folder_generation_prompt.txt` ‚Äî feed this to any AI agent to recreate the structure and files with exact contents. It also defines the expected `structure.txt` tree.
