# Experiments

Keep each experiment small and runnable. One folder = one idea.

## How to add a new experiment
1. Create a folder: `experiments/<topic>/`
2. Copy `templates/experiment_template.md` to `<topic>/README.md`
3. Add a small script: `<topic>/<topic>.py` (or a notebook)
4. Log results in the README.
